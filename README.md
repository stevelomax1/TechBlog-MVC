# TechBlog-MVC

Model-View-Controller (MVC) - a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display.

Description:
A CMS-style blog site where developers who writes about tech can publish articles, blog posts, thoughts, opinions, and comment on other developers’ posts as well.

Usage:
The application follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templated language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
